Description: A Swiss Army knife of utility functions for AHP users which will
    help you assess the consistency of a PCM as well as improve the 
    consistency ratio, compute the sensitivity of a PCM, create a logical,  
    not a random PCM, from the preferences you provide for the alternatives, 
    and a function that helps evaluate the actual consistency of a PCM based on 
    objective, fair bench marking. The toolkit additionally allows a user to 
    specify only the upper triangular comparison ratios of the PCM and performs
    its assigned task.
