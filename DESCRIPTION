Description: A set of three functions for 'AHP' users, namely CR() which 
    evaluates the Consistency Ratio for a given 'PCM', improveCR() for any
    input 'PCM' suggests a matrix with preferences similar to the original 
    preferences, having greater consistency than the input matrix and
    sensitivity() for an input 'PCM' returns the average rank correlation of
    the principal eigenvector of the input 'PCM' and of 500 sample matrices
    generated by random perturbations of elements of the input matrix to 
    within the five nearest elements in the Fundamental Scale.
